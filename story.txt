    There is a girl who is very afraid of dogs. One day, her father did not come to pick her up from her grandparents' home on time, so she had to walk home by herself.
On the way home, there were always some dogs lying at the door of their owner's house. The little girl was terrified, very careful to pass this alley, but she still met those dogs; she was scared and ran up immediately, the dog also chased up. The little girl cried, looked at the dog, who knows, the dog not only caught her up, but
ran in front of her, and smiling? ...The dog owner seemed to hear the little girl's cry and came out. When the dog owner saw the little girl crying, he asked what was wrong.
The little girl answered saying she was walking home alone and the dog startled her. The owner called the dog over and the girl saw how well behaved the dog was. The girl heard a
familiar voice behind her and it was...her father. The father heard her voice while he was on his way to pick up his daughter. Rather than running towards him to be protected from
the dog, she startled her father by petting the dog for the very first time. The little girl realized how loving and caring the dog was. From then on, she never forgot to stop by
the owners house to play with the dog everyday!
