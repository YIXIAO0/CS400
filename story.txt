    There is a girl who is very afraid of dogs. One day, her father did not come to pick her up from her grandparents' home on time, so she had to walk home by herself.
On the way home, there were always some dogs lying at the door of their owner's house. The little girl was terrified, very careful to pass this alley, but she still met those dogs; she was scared and ran up immediately, the dog also chased up. The little girl cried, looked at the dog, who knows, the dog not only caught her up, but
ran in front of her, and smiling? The dog owner seemed to hear the little girl's cry and came out.
